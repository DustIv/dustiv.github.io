# About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m **Dustin Ivander** â€” a student, a creator, and a curious mind exploring the world of visuals and technology.

This site is a personal space where I share my work, ideas, and progress as I grow in the fields I care most about.


## What I Do

- ðŸ“· **Photography** â€“ capturing moments, light, and emotion through still images.
- ðŸŽ¬ **Videography & Cinematography** â€“ telling stories with movement, sound, and atmosphere.
- ðŸ’» **Coding** â€“ currently learning in college and building projects to improve.
- ðŸŒ± **Always Learning** â€“ diving deeper into techniques, tools, and creative processes.


## Why This Site Exists

I built this site to document my journey, experiment with design and code, and have a place to put things Iâ€™m proud of â€” whether itâ€™s a project, a photo series, or a small learning breakthrough.

> *Iâ€™m still learning â€” and this site is growing alongside me.*

Thanks for visiting.
